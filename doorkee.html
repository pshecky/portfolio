    <h3>Roles and Responsibility</h3>

    <br></br>
      <p>Doorkee is an all-in-one apartment rental platform that connects Apartment Seekers, Departing Tenants, and Landlords. It streamlines the rental process by cutting out the broker, eliminating extra fees, and reducing building vacancies.</p>
      <br></br>
      <p>During my internship, I was responsible for conducting competitive research, creating a brand identity and voice, copywriting, and launching their social media presence. I also planned marketing events and designed marketing collateral during closed beta testing.
<br></br>
      <p>As their Social Media Manager, I curate and post content that aligns with Doorkee's brand voice and engage with users on these social platforms.</p>
