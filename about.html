    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>I am currently a Junior at the University of Michigan–School of Information, studying User Experience Design. I am passionate about bridging the gap between technology and people and creating new ways for information to be best relayed between the two. Employing a multitude of perspectives from design thinking and psychology to business strategy, I am able to create both accessible and aesthetic interfaces.</p>

    <p>In my past roles, I have worked extensively with social media (creation and analytics) and brand identity formation. As a former Marketing Intern and current Social Media Manager at Doorkee Inc., I learned first-hand how start-ups operate and what it means to build a business from the group up. For both their website and social media, I collaborated with the Marketing Consultant to generate and convey the company’s brand voice. Additionally, I created content through Adobe Photoshop, Canva, and Figma for all relevant platforms.</p>

    <p>In my free time, I am a HUGE movie/tv nerd. Tell me a movie quote and I’ll name it. Some of my favorites include The Departed, Dreamgirls, 10 Things I Hate About You, Good Will Hunting, and Inglorious Bastards. I am currently watching Netflix’s The Politician and Homeland.</p>
